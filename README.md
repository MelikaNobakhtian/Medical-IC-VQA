# Medical Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering (VQA) Exploration


Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor's degree final project, where I delve into the fascinating realm of image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) within the medical domain. In this project, I extensively explored various methodologies to enhance the understanding of medical images through advanced AI techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To investigate and implement image captioning and visual question answering techniques tailored for medical images.
- **Methodology**: Utilized fine-tuning techniques, particularly focusing on the BLIP model, to enhance image captioning (IC) and VQA capabilities.
- **Datasets**: Experimented with the ROCO dataset for image captioning and developed our proprietary dataset for VQA purposes.
- **Metrics**: Calculated and evaluated relevant metrics to assess the performance.

## Key Features

- **Fine-tuned BLIP Model**: Leveraged the state-of-the-art BLIP model for image captioning and VQA tasks, customized for medical image analysis.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Conducted thorough evaluations using established metrics to measure the efficacy and accuracy of the implemented models.
